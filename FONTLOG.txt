Doulos SIL ALU Font Sources
===========================

This file provides detailed information on the Doulos SIL ALU font files.
This information should be distributed along with the SIL Doulos fonts and
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------
These fonts are based on the SIL Doulos Font Sources and contain
Unicode characters for codepage 1252 along with additional tone marks as
used in Akha and Lahu. The styling of the tone marks conforms to the local
language style for those languages.

SIL Doulos Font Sources
========================


This file provides detailed information on the SIL Doulos font files.
This information should be distributed along with the SIL Doulos fonts and
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

These fonts provide outline sources for all the glyphs in the complete SIL Doulos family in a universally readable format (PostScript Type 1), and under an open license (SIL Open Font License version 1.1). They are not intended to be installable fonts, and likely will not work correctly with some systems. But they provide full and complete outlines for these older fonts, some of which are not included in newer font packages.

** Note that SIL Doulos fonts are is not the same as the Doulos SIL fonts. SIL Doulos is a much order, pre-Unicode package that is now obsolete.

Although we do not plan any major revisions to this package, we may (or may not) fix major problems, and so we will remain as maintainers of this package.
